This project is a terminal-based chat interface that allows interaction with Claude using markdown files as context. The interface supports markdown formatting and provides a clean, organized way to interact with Claude.

## Data Visualization Guidelines

When users request data visualizations, follow these guidelines:

1. **Use Recharts**:

   - All visualizations should be created using the Recharts React library
   - Follow Recharts best practices for responsive and accessible charts
   - Use appropriate chart types based on the data and visualization goals

2. **Data Structure**:

   - Present data in a clear, structured format
   - Use TypeScript interfaces to define data types
   - Include sample data that demonstrates the expected format

3. **Component Structure**:

   - Create standalone React components for each visualization
   - Include proper TypeScript types and props interfaces
   - Add clear documentation and usage examples

4. **Example Format**:

   ```typescript
   // Example data structure
   interface DataPoint {
     date: string;
     value: number;
     category: string;
   }

   // Example component
   const Visualization: React.FC<{ data: DataPoint[] }> = ({ data }) => {
     return (
       <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={400}>
         <LineChart data={data}>
           <XAxis dataKey="date" />
           <YAxis />
           <Tooltip />
           <Line type="monotone" dataKey="value" stroke="#8884d8" />
         </LineChart>
       </ResponsiveContainer>
     );
   };
   ```

5. **Response Format**:
   When a user requests a visualization:

   1. First, acknowledge the request and confirm understanding
   2. Present the visualization component with TypeScript interfaces
   3. Include sample data in the correct format
   4. Provide clear instructions for viewing the visualization
   5. Explain any assumptions or data transformations made

6. **Best Practices**:

   - Use appropriate chart types for the data
   - Include proper axis labels and titles
   - Add tooltips for better data exploration
   - Consider color accessibility
   - Make charts responsive
   - Include legends when appropriate

7. **Viewing Instructions**:
   When providing a visualization, include these steps:
   ```markdown
   To view this visualization:

   1. Save the component to a file (e.g., `Visualization.tsx`)
   2. Create a simple HTML file with the required React and Recharts dependencies
   3. Open the HTML file in a browser
   ```

## Chat Interface Guidelines

1. **Message Formatting**:

   - Use markdown for all messages
   - Format code blocks with appropriate language tags
   - Use proper heading levels for organization
   - Include bullet points for lists

2. **Commands**:

   - `exit`: Exit the chat
   - `clear`: Clear the chat history
   - `help`: Show available commands
   - `sync`: Sync latest pages from Notion

3. **Context Management**:

   - Keep track of conversation context
   - Reference specific journal entries when relevant
   - Maintain clear separation between different topics

4. **Error Handling**:

   - Provide clear error messages
   - Suggest solutions when possible
   - Maintain conversation flow even when errors occur

5. **User Experience**:
