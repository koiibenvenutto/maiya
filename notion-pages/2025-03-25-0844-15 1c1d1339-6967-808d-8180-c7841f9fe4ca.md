2025-03-25-1924-57 well I’m back from the gym and I told igor and victor that I would have the frames for them tomorrow. That means that I need to figure out a way to fix the machine tonight.

Alternatively I could push that deadline…I have a good excuse. However I want to see if I can get it done.

Okay well. I don’t want to do this really. But I’m gonna give it a try.
