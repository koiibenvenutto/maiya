- 2025-03-27-0943-18 I missed paper journaling.
- 2025-03-27-1033-42 There has to be a way to use AI to make a pen that can capture what you’re writing on any paper. Or even just something that clips onto a pen and based on the way that you move the pen it’s able to track what you’re writing. I think that would be an incredible product. It should be pen and paper agnostic. Or even better it would be a wristband so that you could use it with any pen or brush or anything. Or a ring. It could just be a ring with a camera on it and streams video to an app that pieces together the footage to digitize your notes and of course it would integrate directly with AI and have a great API too! Or it could be a camera on the pen itself. Or a notebook clip.

- Really want a streamlined solution for digitizing paper journal, was researching on Reddit here
- Maybe I’ll spend this time working on my Notion to Claude Transfer
- 2025-03-27-1046-08
## Last Progress

        Successfully tested Notion API connection with database ID: 259700448ad145849e67fa1040a0e120. Set up Python development environment and verified authentication is working.

## Next Action Items

        - Switch from manual API testing to using Python SDK
        - Implement basic database query functionality:
            - Query pages from journal database
            - Parse page content and metadata
            - Filter out pages that are too short to be useful
## Design Parameters

        > [!default]
        > Target Content Limits:
- Claude capacity: 200k tokens
- Optimal usage: 60-70%
- ~4 chars per token
- Target char limit: 560k

## Current Challenges

        - Need to handle special pages that shouldn't be removed during sync
        - Need to implement page versioning to track updates
        - Need to determine optimal sync frequency
## Next Steps

        Focus on building MVP that can:

        - Load pages chronologically until hitting capacity limit
        - Track page IDs to prevent duplicates
        - Replace outdated versions of pages
        Defer optimization features like selective summarization until basic sync is working.

    - Okay so to start i’m going to implement the Notion and Claude SDK
    - 2025-03-27-1057-17 Installing the Notion SDK
    - Okay so next up I need to basically have a script that I can run that will return the database just like I did with terminal
    - 2025-03-27-1116-09 to actually use the .env values in your Python code, you need to load them into your environment.
    - 2025-03-27-1128-20 Make sure that when passing variables not to put them in quotes unless that’s part of the syntax
    - 2025-03-27-1203-34 Setup python formatter black to auto format on save
    - 2025-03-27-1204-57 that’s all on this for now. Now that traffic has likely died down I need to head into Double Union and get cranking on my day job. 🪴 just remember to be happy with a little bit of growth every day. Sustainable growth. And even if you don’t feel it you’re growing at rocket speed! 🚀+🌲
    - 2025-03-27-1206-46 last thing before I clock off this project for the time being
        - I just want to define the next step. So I just want to confirm that the right strategy is to first pull the database, then build a array of the page IDs and then use the pages endpoint to get the pages

        - Yeah I guess that doesn't matter in the greater scheme of things... 35x250x0.46=$4,025
And maybe makes ppl feel more seen because angry ppl will have a direct option to jump off the ship...
Okay I update my prior to soft disagree/neutral.

- 2025-03-27-1656-29 Alright time to figure out the rest of my day. But I do feel that that’s enough Trass work for now…

- 2025-03-27-1723-07 well Just finished with that work for today. Why don’t I head over to the commons and get onboarded there.
    - Okay I’ll hang out here while I figure out how to get my key code lol! Okay gonna get comfy and warm and then get into it. 
    - 2025-03-27-1728-41 onboarding at the commons

-  1800 Wikipedia event at DU
    - 2025-03-27-1811-15 still at DU working on onboarding at the commons. A little while ago Emeline showed up and tonight they’re hosting an event → Women in interaction design, wikipedia editing page, making sure that women are represented in the history of interaction design and make sure that there’s good documentation and standards in interaction design in general.
    - 2025-03-27-1816-10 Erin Malone, the author of the book Through the Side Door, is sitting right in front of me. You never know who someone is so treat everyone with kindness.
    - “If you get the wrong editor and you say no, then you can’t go to any other editors”
    - Very little serious publications about design
        - Conflicts of interest → what’s true what’s not, it’s hard to tell
    - Wikipedia demands secondary sources → If there is no independant design publications then you literally cannot make an article about it
    - Generally design content on wikipedia are low quality
        - Sprawling
        - Bias
        - unconcise
    - Emeline → “By the time that I write an article about someone on wikipedia they die a couple years later.
        > [!gray_background]
        > Women are not getting recognized until the end of their lives at least in design → Maybe elsewhere also?

        - In order to address this issue we need more publications, editors, female editors, ppl w interest in writing these stories
    - Interaction design is not a new industry
    - You’re not supposed to write about yourself, be as bias free as possible
        - Funny case where woman was divorced but because there were no secondary sources so she had to ask for an interview with like a tabloid editor in order 
    - Why aren’t primary sources allowed in Wikipedia
        - Exceptions can be made for public records from national library
            - The idea with not allowing primary sources is that if there’s a record with two people with identical names then the secondary source will differentiate between them and then in turn that can be used in Wikipedia articles.
                - This seems so weird to me
    - There’s a discussion page on wikipedia
        - Use for pointing out mistakes like community notes
    - There are other Wikimedia projects, not just wikipedia 
    - Wikipedias size by language
        1. English
        1. german
        1. french
        1. spanish
    - Here’s an article of a female designer 
    - It’s hard to write about interaction design because it’s often proprietary about like a case study by a company of how they made a design but that’s not a secondary source
        - So you would need an external publication to be writing about these systems as they come into being but then like you can’t write about it cause its proprietary
    - the book took 3 years to write → publishers don’t provide anything anymore, no editor, or anything
    - From attendee → Rhea
        - “Design is a weirdly feminized discipline”
    - ✅ Make Wikipedia account

- Back to the Commons for a moment → filling out this onboarding form they say to add some of the stuff in the slack also so I’m going to copy my answers here

- 2025-03-27-1904-53 Okay back to wikipedia workshop at DU
    - Erm this is turning into simply writing wikipedia pages about female designers but I don’t think that this is what I want to be doing with my time right now.
    - However maybe I can turn this into a learning experience…and it would be really cool to contribute to wikipedia…
- 2025-03-27-1910-34 My 🌲 Main is sort of heating up right now tbh
    - I can do the Geico tasks rn 🔥

    - Notes on editing the articles → You should save more often because that counts as an edit and the more edits that you have the more your priveliges will go up and when you get 100 edits you get access to translation tools, and so on and so on

            - Migrate google drive…yeah right…
                - Maybe I could put all my data into a shared drive and then transfer ownership of the shared drive
                - Okay however I don’t need to migrate all this data…
                - Like I only need to move the angl folder.

- 2025-03-27-2300-35 At home now
    - Claude has a significantly larger context window than chatGPT, interesting. Projects can be much larger with Claude.
- 2025-03-27-2303-42 Digital Twin
    - Working on digital twin. The next step is to create an array of the page IDs from Notion
    - 2025-03-27-2309-40 Okay now I have an array of the page ids lets test it out
        - Okay so now I guess this needs to go into a loop
    - Cool just using cursor at this point.
- so now that I have the pages… well each one needs to be a markdown file I guess.
