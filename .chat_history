+It's monday and I'm feeling really ugh like discombobulated. I feel guilty for not working on trass games and I'm feeling frustrated that I spent the weekend working on this article for my blog. However I'm not really satisfied with the way that my blog is styled and that causes me to feel frustrated because I've already put so much work into it. I know that I'm going to want the blog to be my own space but I'm having trouble finding the time to keep it up and impliment it in a way that I'm satisfied with. I feel like it needs another redesign. Which is super frustrating. I ultimately was able to add support for code snippets today but it's 2025-03-31-1226-21 and I'm just feeling behind and all mixed up, I'm still in my pjs. I just feel like I have too much on my plate. I know I need to be patient and that little by little I'll get where I'm trying to go but it's just frstrating feeling like one projects is bumping into another and like dominos the start of my week feels like a trainwreck. I want sundays to be a day for rest but when i can't fit stuff in the week then the weekends turn into project time and then monday I wake up tired and as I said discomobulated.
