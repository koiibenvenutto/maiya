+It's monday and I'm feeling really ugh like discombobulated. I feel guilty for not working on trass games and I'm feeling frustrated that I spent the weekend working on this article for my blog. However I'm not really satisfied with the way that my blog is styled and that causes me to feel frustrated because I've already put so much work into it. I know that I'm going to want the blog to be my own space but I'm having trouble finding the time to keep it up and impliment it in a way that I'm satisfied with. I feel like it needs another redesign. Which is super frustrating. I ultimately was able to add support for code snippets today but it's 2025-03-31-1226-21 and I'm just feeling behind and all mixed up, I'm still in my pjs. I just feel like I have too much on my plate. I know I need to be patient and that little by little I'll get where I'm trying to go but it's just frstrating feeling like one projects is bumping into another and like dominos the start of my week feels like a trainwreck. I want sundays to be a day for rest but when i can't fit stuff in the week then the weekends turn into project time and then monday I wake up tired and as I said discomobulated.

+Well it's still going honestly.

# 2025-04-04 22:51:29.714072
+It's 2025-04-04-2250-25 just got back from watching the Minecraft movie with the team but like I'm 26 and they feel like little kids to me. the difference between 26 and 20-23ish is insane. Likd something happens in between there and you're just not a kid anymore. I feel alone. I feel sad. I feel empty.

# 2025-04-04 23:04:22.477784
+I feel incredibily alone. Well that's te first thing that I thought after reading this message. I feel incredibly lonely. I have Graham and we have a deep and profound connection but when the team and I were walking down the street in the Marina district in San Francisco and looking at all the beautiful people there and all the groups of friends it just made me feel really other and really like...a spy or an imposter in my body. Isaw all these girls hanging out together and just longed to be one of them. They seem care free, ignorant, they look like they feel together, part of something. I guess everyone feels like part of not me. Graham is the only person who I don't feel alone with but I feel a profound gap in my life socially. I don't know who my friends are supposed to be. All my girlfriends feel like they're not like me at all. I want a trans best friend who's around my age and similar to me but the issue is that no one is like me. No one is like me. That's how I feel.

# 2025-04-04 23:21:07.472884
+When I read "I wonder if part of what you're feeling is grief - grief for the girlhood 
+experiences you didn't get to have" I cried. I think this hits the nail right on the head. I feel a deep emptiness that's been growing inside me for a long time. I wonder if this is going to keep growing. Things have been getting better for so long but now I'm wondering what's next...what's going to happen now. It's hard to always be growing because it means that you leave everyone behind. This is why I know that I will be with Graham for the rest of my life. He's my only relationship that isn't dependant on me being in a certain stage of my life.

+I wonder if finding ways to honor your grief might help. Sometimes acknowledging
+what's been lost, even symbolically, can create space for new possibilities. 
+Perhaps there are certain girlhood experiences you could reclaim or reimagine 
+now, not to replace what wasn't possible then, but to give yourself permission 
+to explore them in ways meaningful to you today. How do I do this? Give me some suggestions.

+I love all these ideas, this feels good and nurturing but my mind is drawing a blank as far as conrete examples of their implementation. I would like to start with a hand written letter, however I don't have any paper with me...maybe I can find some. I like that one because it's simple and I can do it now. I'm gonna go look for some paper. Also I'm at the office and I need to get home tonight.

+We need to conduct a user interview tomorrow theres two fascilitors, me and jayshay and we will have two groups. In each group there will be two kids and a parent. In the past I've only done user interviews one on one. The total session will be two hours long. so we need to have a very simply starting question to get a baseline for the kids level of enthusiasm and personality so we understand how to guage their reactions during the process of making the maker kits. (there should be some context about the maker kits in my daily logs)Here's our current plan for reference: Yeeps Maker Research Session 1

+Hey I'm coming off a bender of a week. I was working hard, like long full days, spending any spare energy on dates with my boyfriend and drinking more than usual I haven't had time to take care of myself outside of doing my hair which has been giving me life recently but I feel rough because I just haven't gone to the rock climbing gym in forever. I haven't gone running or done yoga in over a week. It's been 12 days since I last exercised aside from living an active lifestyle. I've been drinking a lot of coffee and I just feel really worn down right now. It's sunday. I have work again tomorrow and as you can see from my journal I had work today also. So I just feel totally toasted. I feel like Angl is totally up in the air right now. That's a whole thought dump of where I've been recently. I have been having really hateful thoughts toward other trans people too and just feeling like I want nothing to do with that community. Ugh just so much in general. Feeling zapped on energy right now like I'm gonna crash later. IDK

# 2025-04-06 17:46:51.763735
+I just want to start taking steps to get myself back on track right now.

# 2025-04-06 17:52:57.530656
+I just drank half my full waterbottle. That feels good for sure. I guess to really recover I need to be in my own space. Right now I'm at Founders inc where I work. However I really hate going home. I don't mind it too much when I'm there but I'm really not interested in being around my mom right now. I am so done living in Alameda. I really want to move to SF. But that's a problem for a later time. I can go downstairs to a part of f inc where there's more space for chilling and see if there's an area where I can do some movement. I think that's a good idea. I'm just not wearing super movement condusive clothing but like hey whatever right.

# 2025-04-06 19:00:21.151015
+2025-04-06-1858-12 Wow well I just did a 35+ minute long yoga session in the Founders inc gym and did not hold back at all. I feel so much better. And you know what, I don’t even smell bad at all nor are my clothes sweat soked or anything. In fact I don’t think that someone could tell that I just did a vigorous workout at all.

# 2025-04-06 19:02:54.609797
+I would like to keep this reversal of trend going and continue locking in this restorative energy. What do you suggest I do next?

# 2025-04-06 19:05:52.435955
+I think that a big healthy meal would be the ideal way to lock in these routines. My body needs good healthy energy. There's nothing like a home cooked meal to really heal me. I even have some frozen pork stock in my freezer that will make me feel so wonderful and warm inside. I don't really like going home after being in this amazin place. However, it's the necessary next step here to make sure that I'm ready to go for tomorrow.

# 2025-04-06 19:07:50.670154
+I think I just need to remember my experience going from Founders Inc to Double union. I don't think you have that in your context, however that was a time recently where I didn't want to leave but it ended up being a really wonderful and needed time.

# 2025-04-06 19:12:21.103053
+My intention for heading home is to rest and reset myself for tomorrow so that I'm totally ready to go. 

# 2025-04-06 19:13:54.638919
+Yes I agree. I know that I will feel the urge to work tonight. However I want to purposefully hold back from working on any of my projects. They will all be there waiting when I'm ready.

# 2025-04-06 19:19:05.452940
+Yes that's right. And my medium term intention is to move to San Francisco. I am ready to start a new part of my life. And this time I'm going to remember that Graham helps me. In fact I'm going to start making him instruction booklets. And you're going to help. In fact I already started this a little bit because of my last session with my therapist where we made like a safety guide or whatever. Something that I can share with Graham to make sure that he knows what to do when I am having an OCD episode. However my work here is just beginning. So much and what feels like so little time. However I know that how bad I want it and the impatience that I feel is actually the guarantee that this work will all come to fruition and to be thankful and grateful for the sensation of impatience no matter how uncomfortable it may feel in the moment.

# 2025-04-06 19:23:45.947162
+Great chat. What emoji should I use to represent you. Make sure it's aesthetic not the robot.

# 2025-04-06 21:43:40.625734
+2025-04-06-2140-04 I'm at home now. I've done as I said i was going to do and eaten a nice big wholesome meal of veggies, chicken, rice, and a salad with home made dressing and avocados. Doesn't get better than that. I'm actually feeling really good right now. I had a nice phone call with my dad. That was really nice. and I got an amazing price from the Chinese maufacturing for angl frames. I'm in a great place right now. It's the perfect time to reconnect with my journal. there's so much ahead of me that I'm so excited for. In the moment though, I simply need to take a step back and think about my next steps this evening orienting toward a nice soft landing into my bed at a reasonable time so that I'm ready to crush it tomorrow.
