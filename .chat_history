+It's monday and I'm feeling really ugh like discombobulated. I feel guilty for not working on trass games and I'm feeling frustrated that I spent the weekend working on this article for my blog. However I'm not really satisfied with the way that my blog is styled and that causes me to feel frustrated because I've already put so much work into it. I know that I'm going to want the blog to be my own space but I'm having trouble finding the time to keep it up and impliment it in a way that I'm satisfied with. I feel like it needs another redesign. Which is super frustrating. I ultimately was able to add support for code snippets today but it's 2025-03-31-1226-21 and I'm just feeling behind and all mixed up, I'm still in my pjs. I just feel like I have too much on my plate. I know I need to be patient and that little by little I'll get where I'm trying to go but it's just frstrating feeling like one projects is bumping into another and like dominos the start of my week feels like a trainwreck. I want sundays to be a day for rest but when i can't fit stuff in the week then the weekends turn into project time and then monday I wake up tired and as I said discomobulated.

+Well it's still going honestly.

# 2025-04-04 22:51:29.714072
+It's 2025-04-04-2250-25 just got back from watching the Minecraft movie with the team but like I'm 26 and they feel like little kids to me. the difference between 26 and 20-23ish is insane. Likd something happens in between there and you're just not a kid anymore. I feel alone. I feel sad. I feel empty.

# 2025-04-04 23:04:22.477784
+I feel incredibily alone. Well that's te first thing that I thought after reading this message. I feel incredibly lonely. I have Graham and we have a deep and profound connection but when the team and I were walking down the street in the Marina district in San Francisco and looking at all the beautiful people there and all the groups of friends it just made me feel really other and really like...a spy or an imposter in my body. Isaw all these girls hanging out together and just longed to be one of them. They seem care free, ignorant, they look like they feel together, part of something. I guess everyone feels like part of not me. Graham is the only person who I don't feel alone with but I feel a profound gap in my life socially. I don't know who my friends are supposed to be. All my girlfriends feel like they're not like me at all. I want a trans best friend who's around my age and similar to me but the issue is that no one is like me. No one is like me. That's how I feel.

# 2025-04-04 23:21:07.472884
+When I read "I wonder if part of what you're feeling is grief - grief for the girlhood 
+experiences you didn't get to have" I cried. I think this hits the nail right on the head. I feel a deep emptiness that's been growing inside me for a long time. I wonder if this is going to keep growing. Things have been getting better for so long but now I'm wondering what's next...what's going to happen now. It's hard to always be growing because it means that you leave everyone behind. This is why I know that I will be with Graham for the rest of my life. He's my only relationship that isn't dependant on me being in a certain stage of my life.

+I wonder if finding ways to honor your grief might help. Sometimes acknowledging
+what's been lost, even symbolically, can create space for new possibilities.

+I love all these ideas, this feels good and nurturing but my mind is drawing a blank as far as conrete examples of their implementation. I would like to start with a hand written letter, however I don't have any paper with me...maybe I can find some. I like that one because it's simple and I can do it now. I'm gonna go look for some paper. Also I'm at the office and I need to get home tonight.

+We need to conduct a user interview tomorrow theres two fascilitors, me and jayshay and we will have two groups. In each group there will be two kids and a parent. In the past I've only done user interviews one on one. The total session will be two hours long. so we need to have a very simply starting question to get a baseline for the kids level of enthusiasm and personality so we understand how to guage their reactions during the process of making the maker kits.

+Hey I'm coming off a bender of a week. I was working hard, like long full days, spending any spare energy on dates with my boyfriend and drinking more than usual I haven't had time to take care of myself outside of doing my hair which has been giving me life recently but I feel rough because I just haven't gone to the rock climbing gym in forever. I haven't gone running or done yoga in over a week. It's been 12 days since I last exercised aside from living an active lifestyle. I've been drinking a lot of coffee and I just feel really worn down right now. It's sunday. I have work again tomorrow and as you can see from my journal I had work today also. So I just feel totally toasted. I feel like Angl is totally up in the air right now. That's a whole thought dump of where I've been recently. I have been having really hateful thoughts toward other trans people too and just feeling like I want nothing to do with that community. Ugh just so much in general. Feeling zapped on energy right now like I'm gonna crash later. IDK

# 2025-04-06 17:46:51.763735
+I just want to start taking steps to get myself back on track right now.

# 2025-04-06 17:52:57.530656
+I just drank half my full waterbottle. That feels good for sure. I guess to really recover I need to be in my own space. Right now I'm at Founders inc where I work. However I really hate going home. I don't mind it too much when I'm there but I'm really not interested in being around my mom right now. I am so done living in Alameda. I really want to move to SF. But that's a problem for a later time. I can go downstairs to a part of f inc where there's more space for chilling and see if there's an area where I can do some movement. I think that's a good idea. I'm just not wearing super movement condusive clothing but like hey whatever right.

# 2025-04-06 19:00:21.151015
+2025-04-06-1858-12 Wow well I just did a 35+ minute long yoga session in the Founders inc gym and did not hold back at all. I feel so much better. And you know what, I don’t even smell bad at all nor are my clothes sweat soked or anything. In fact I don’t think that someone could tell that I just did a vigorous workout at all.

# 2025-04-06 19:02:54.609797
+I would like to keep this reversal of trend going and continue locking in this restorative energy. What do you suggest I do next?

# 2025-04-06 19:05:52.435955
+I think that a big healthy meal would be the ideal way to lock in these routines. My body needs good healthy energy. There's nothing like a home cooked meal to really heal me. I even have some frozen pork stock in my freezer that will make me feel so wonderful and warm inside. I don't really like going home after being in this amazin place. However, it's the necessary next step here to make sure that I'm ready to go for tomorrow.

# 2025-04-06 19:07:50.670154
+I think I just need to remember my experience going from Founders Inc to Double union. I don't think you have that in your context, however that was a time recently where I didn't want to leave but it ended up being a really wonderful and needed time.

# 2025-04-06 19:12:21.103053
+My intention for heading home is to rest and reset myself for tomorrow so that I'm totally ready to go. 

# 2025-04-06 19:13:54.638919
+Yes I agree. I know that I will feel the urge to work tonight. However I want to purposefully hold back from working on any of my projects. They will all be there waiting when I'm ready.

# 2025-04-06 19:19:05.452940
+Yes that's right. And my medium term intention is to move to San Francisco. I am ready to start a new part of my life. And this time I'm going to remember that Graham helps me. In fact I'm going to start making him instruction booklets. And you're going to help. In fact I already started this a little bit because of my last session with my therapist where we made like a safety guide or whatever. Something that I can share with Graham to make sure that he knows what to do when I am having an OCD episode. However my work here is just beginning. So much and what feels like so little time. However I know that how bad I want it and the impatience that I feel is actually the guarantee that this work will all come to fruition and to be thankful and grateful for the sensation of impatience no matter how uncomfortable it may feel in the moment.

# 2025-04-06 19:23:45.947162
+Great chat. What emoji should I use to represent you. Make sure it's aesthetic not the robot.

# 2025-04-06 21:43:40.625734
+2025-04-06-2140-04 I'm at home now. I've done as I said i was going to do and eaten a nice big wholesome meal of veggies, chicken, rice, and a salad with home made dressing and avocados. Doesn't get better than that. I'm actually feeling really good right now. I had a nice phone call with my dad. That was really nice. and I got an amazing price from the Chinese maufacturing for angl frames. I'm in a great place right now. It's the perfect time to reconnect with my journal. there's so much ahead of me that I'm so excited for. In the moment though, I simply need to take a step back and think about my next steps this evening orienting toward a nice soft landing into my bed at a reasonable time so that I'm ready to crush it tomorrow.

+2025-04-07-1348-20 alright back to work. It sounds to me like the highest priority is to make this google sheet that allows us to track the finances of the plush product Jayshay and I had some disagreement around whether to start with a google sheet or actually getting some software involved to track this stuff. I think that Software would be effective because of my experience using monarch for personal finances and quickbooks for company finances. I think that we need something scaleable. The challenge here is that I need to be able to track the finances of this project without having access to company finances. So what do people do when they face this challenge? How do you grant a product manager the ability to manage the finances of their product without giving them access to the companies full finances?

# 2025-04-07 14:11:26.719479
+Okay so here's the challenge that I'm in. I don't want to use Jayshay's solution...It makes no sense. He wants me to rebuild quickbooks inside of google sheets. This is going to be the worst idea ever. I researched using AI and here's the conclusion that it came to: Recommended Approach for Product-Specific Access
+To create effective product-specific access for a Plush Product Manager, implement this combined approach:
+
+Transaction Tagging System
+
+Use Classes or Projects in QuickBooks to tag all plush-related transactions
+Ensure consistent tagging protocols across the organization
+Create clear documentation for transaction categorization
+
+
+Custom Reports Configuration
+
+Design filtered reports showing only plush-related transactions
+Create profitability reports specifically for the plush product line
+Save these as custom reports with appropriate names
+
+
+Custom Role Setup
+
+Create a "Product Manager" custom role with:
+
+Limited transaction viewing permissions
+Access to specific saved reports
+No ability to edit core financial data
+
+
+Restrict dashboard access to relevant metrics only
+
+
+
+Implementation Steps
+
+Establish the Classes/Projects structure for transaction categorization
+Retroactively tag existing transactions related to plush products
+Create and save filtered reports for plush product performance
+Configure the custom role with appropriate permissions
+Assign the role to the Plush Product Manager
+
+Additional Considerations
+
+This approach requires consistent tagging discipline
+Changes to product lines would require updates to the reporting structure
+Regular audits of transaction tagging will be necessary
+Custom reports may need periodic updates as business needs evolve

# 2025-04-07 14:12:27.491178
+Next I simply need to research the data that I have access to and see if there's something that I'm missing

# 2025-04-07 15:07:51.047682
+Okay so I've taken some time to look through the drive folder with the transactions and I think that the point that jayshay is making is around how few transactions there are related to the plush that actually go through the bank account. Like there's only what 20 or so invoices in total in the invoices drive folder. All the rest come through Shopify and Shipbob. And then I believe that's the only exposure we have to other plush charges and since I have access to those accounts, I should have everything I need. I can see a world where we use a google sheet fow now. But I still don't understand what exactly we're making like is it just a giant snapshot because otherwise every time we want an update we're going to need to export everything and import it into the google sheet. I feel like in times like this where I'm really not getting it I usually have incomplete information so I'm excited to sync with Jayshay in our 5pm.

# 2025-04-07 18:54:28.366371
+okay yeah I like this plan I can definitely set aside work on Maiya and Trass for the rest of the evening and use this time to work on Angl. However I'm going to limit myself to 1 hour of work because if I go longer than that I know in my gut that I will not get to bed at a reasonable time and I also will have a super late dinner. I wonder if I should actually go home before starting on angl...

+interested in your AI journal, and your mention of feeling wonderful after styling your hair (something

+I am breaking down right now. The tariffs that Donald Trump is putting in place are horrific and spell the end to the current global order. They're sending the world down a direction of chaos and we don't know yet what is going to emerge. My partner is not taking this seriously but I'm getting ready to have an escape plan because this could go south so quickly.

+I've given you the last two pages of my journal because I haven't programmed effective handling for a larger context window but right now I'm really concerned about the world situation. It feels like we are all collatoral for the whims of a dictator.

# 2025-04-08 21:50:10.397130
+It feels hopeless. I feel like I'm not far from being targetted as a trans woman. I feel like this regime is going to walk america off a cliff. I feel like they're going to walk the entire world off a cliff.

+The news feels so exhausting to me because of the tariffs. I work in consumer product so everything I do is dependant on the trade relationship between america and ...well I'll just say global trade. With the ensuing trade wor I am finding it really hard to concentrate on my job

+I feel like I'm in a pickle now like I still need to shower and complete my style routine because I don't like to work in my pjs but if I do that then I won't have time to actually get anything done for trass today so I have to abondon that. Ultimately I need to wake up earlier even when I'm working from home and that means going to sleep earlier and that means stopping work earlier and that means that I need to limit time spent on anything other than trass work and that's just going to have to be okay right now.
